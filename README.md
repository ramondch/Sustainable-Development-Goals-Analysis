Freshwater resources play a significant role in a country’s socioeconomic development, and are utilized in agricultural, industrial, household, and other activities. **The improvement of efficient water consumption and water productivity is a key indicator to be monitored** by international and national policy makers, to adjust adaptive macroeconomic policies that affect demand and investment in water-related activities.

Triggered by rising global challenges of population growth and climate change, a country’s stable water supply that is resilient to scarcity and shocks becomes one of the key enablers for a healthy socioeconomic development.

The exercise aims to provide a visual analysis to support World Bank leadership and program colleagues to effectively mainstream freshwater efficiency and productivity into different aspects of design and planning of a country specific project.
